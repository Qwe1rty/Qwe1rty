Hey! I'm Caleb, a graduate from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Software Engineering. 

My work experiences mainly include working on backend and infra systems, with a heavy emphasis on C++/Golang tooling. 
In particular, my domain specialty is knowledge into databases and high-performance distributed systems, the former of which I've done a deep dive by creating two separate database systems from scratch: NodeDial, and LooDB. Check them out!
